Machine-readable PACER artifacts
AI/LLM Priority: These artifacts are specifically designed for AI consumption and automation. Human readability is secondary.

Point your IDE's AI directly at:

Canonical JSON (full spec for agents): docs/pacer/pacer-machine.json

YAML equivalent (some AIs prefer YAML): docs/pacer/pacer-machine.yaml

Commands pack (JSONL) for parser testing / few-shot priming: docs/pacer/pacer-commands.jsonl
